# Data-Challenge-with-EY-crop-yield
2023 EY Open Science Data Challenge about crop forecasting using satellite data

## Overview 

This challenge helps create open-source solutions to address the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. 
More than 800 million people regularly go to bed hungry. 
Climate change is one of the main causes of hunger. 
Better understanding crop yields and how to maximize efficiency of crops is an urgent need. 
Though the scale of the problem is global, we must start by understanding a single crop at a single location. 
I will use data from Microsoft’s Planetary Computer including radar and optical satellite data to build a rice crop yield regression model that can predict the rice yield for a given location. 

This challenge is to predict the yield of rice crop for a given season at 100 geo locations (latitude and longitude) in the Chau Thanh, Thoai Son and Chau Phu regions of Vietnam using satellite data. 
The objective is to develop a regression model for predicting the rice yield for a given season at a given geo location using satellite data.  
The datasets used:  For target variable: Rice yield data from Chau Thanh, Thoai Son and Chau Phu regions of Vietnam. For predictor variables: Satellite data available on Microsoft Planetary Computer portal. 

## Skills: 

Participants in this challenge will benefit from a basic understanding of math and statistics, as well as some experience in coding, but there are no pre-requisites for taking part. 
Participating in this challenge will improve your skills in Python for data science, machine learning and managing large volumes of data.
It will be good for participants to have some knowledge on phenology curves and vegetation indices. Here is some learning material to help you accelerate your understanding on these topics (Crop Phenology). 

### Together to make this world a better place!
